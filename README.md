# carnd_advanced_lane_detection

This is my take at Udacity's self driving car engineer nanodegree, term1, project 4. Some of the code is written 
by Udacity people, just copy-pasted and refactored by me. 

## How to run
To run the program, just install the dependencis (e.g. using the carnd term1 starter kit) and then 
```python
from carnd_advanced_lane_detection.detect_lanes import detect_lanes
detect_lanes()
```
or run the `detect_lines.py` file as a script.

If you want to tinker with different input videos or modify output path, you need to modify the code, see the 
`detect_lanes()` function and the ones it calls for details, it should be pretty straightforward.

Note: if you want to do this without the starter kit, I am not aware of the dependencies. Refer to FIXME:add_link for details. 

## Written report

To take a look at my writeup for the project, see FIXME:add_link.
